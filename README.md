# Unified Modules for Stormworks Server Addons

This is a modular addon system for Stormworks servers, meant to allow easy customization, and extension while maximizing code reusability and performance.

Building currently requires use of the Stormworks VSCode extension which can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NameousChangey.lifeboatapi).

There is still a lot to do:
- Re-implement all Dangleworks/Gunsworks addons as modules
- Test all modules thoroughly
- Create documentation for module creation
- Implement all hooks in the main script.lua file
- Create system for vehicle files and playlist.xml automation using build action scripts
