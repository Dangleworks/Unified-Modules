-- This file is called just prior to the build process starting
-- Can add any pre-build actions; such as any code generation processes you wish, or other tool chains
-- Regular lua - you have access to the filesystem etc. via LBFilesystem
-- Recommend using LBFilepath for paths, to keep things easy

print("Build Started - No additional actions taken in _build/_pre_buildactions.lua")
